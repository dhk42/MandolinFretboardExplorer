# MandolinFretboardExplorer
 Java Swing project to explore the mandolin fretboard and create chord diagrams
 
 This project uses JFreeSVG for the generation of SVG fretboard diagrams.

 The intent is to create an application for my own use to aid in the 
 memorization/understanding of the mandolin fretboard and note relationships.
 
 If anyone else finds it useful, that's great. It is very much a work in progress, though.
